							<h1>VP Joe</h1>

                After twenty years in industry doing consulting, start-ups and big tech I've decided to share some of what I learned in
                building and running software teams.
              </p>
              <p class="major">
                VP Joe is my way of sharing some of these hard won lessons with anyone who can benefit. If you are a founder trying to
                establish your first team or new to leadership in an established organization, I have been in that situation and found
                what works and what doesn't.

							<h2>My Story</h2>
							<p>
                I started my career in consulting, first in NYC and later in Amsterdam. My clients varied from small companies to
                government agencies to large multinationals. Microsoft SharePoint was all the rage at the time and I was good at
                leveraging that platform. This part of my professional life taught me how to work with clients, how to understand
                their business needs and how to run my own company.
              </p>
              <p>
                Life brings about changes however and I next found myself working as an engineer for a startup in Canada. Fast
                forward a few months and I was leading the engineering department there which lasted for a few years until a
                successful exit. Those were intense years that taught me a lot. I wanted to see if I could repeat that success
                and joined another startup as engineering lead, seeing that one exit in two years.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next step took me to big tech as an engineering lead at Google. I’ve led teams in the healthcare space,
                ran an AI team, worked on collaboration and am currently busy running a data team in Boulder. Throughout it all I’ve
                maintained a focus on helping individuals and teams grow to their best potential.
